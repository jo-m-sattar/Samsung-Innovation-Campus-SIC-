My Python Journey – Samsung Innovation Campus

This repository documents my learning journey in Python through the Samsung Innovation Campus (SIC) program.
It brings together all the tasks, exercises, and projects I completed along the way.

The code here isn’t perfect, but it reflects my progress step by step, moving from simple practice problems to more meaningful projects.
I decided to share it publicly because I believe that learning is a journey best shared. Maybe my work can help someone just starting out, the same way I’ve learned from others online.

*Every file in this repo is more than just code; it’s a milestone in my growth as a programmer.*
